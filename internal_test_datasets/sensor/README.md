# ABCE_Open_Data_Project
This is a sample of sensor data.

This is from an old recording of a Hobo U12 sensor. The raw data file is exactly as it is when downloaded from the sensor.

For this example, let's pretend this was recorded in the atrium of the Sir Frank Gibb building.

Things to consider:
- should the csv file be cleaned or published as is?
- can the csv file be converted to csvw?
- example analysis should also be included.

Other data to include:
- make and model of sensor which made these measurements.
- location of the sensor.
- who made the measurements.
