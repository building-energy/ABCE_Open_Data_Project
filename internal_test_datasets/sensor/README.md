This folder contains an example of how to analyse the 'Sensor data example' dataset.

The dataset itself can be viewed here: https://figshare.com/s/68005bc2612df7f7a404

The files in this folder are:
- this README.md file.
- a Jupyter Notebook named 'examples_of_data_analysis.ipynb' which contains examples, written in Python, of how to analyse the dataset. This notebook can be viewed directly in GitHub or on NBViewer here: https://nbviewer.org/github/building-energy/ABCE_Open_Data_Project/blob/main/internal_test_datasets/sensor/examples_of_data_analysis.ipynb
- a file named 'time_series_plot.png' which is an example plot created by the analysis in the Jupyter Notebook.
