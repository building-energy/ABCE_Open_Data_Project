ABCE Open Data Project - Image data example
------------------------------------------------

The aim of this example is to demonstrate a method of publishing image data in a manner which is open, understandable and reusable. 

This is part of a Loughborough University project studying Open and FAIR data publishing using the CSV on the Web (CSVW) standard.

This is a fictional dataset with images, information and metadata.

The files in this dataset are:

- readme.txt: 
  - An introduction to the dataset, placed both in a readme.txt file and as the description on the Figshare data item page.

- IMG_0517, IMG_0518, IMG_0519, IMG_0520, IMG_0521:  
  - Images taken arround ABCE, Loughborough University, UK. 

- dataset.csv:
  - This file is created from images files and related information.
  
- dataset.csv-metadata.json: 
  - A CSV on the Web (CSVW) metadata file containing metadata for the 'dataset.csv' file.
  - This additional file has been created to fully describe the data in the CSV file.
  - The metadata includes descriptions of the datasets and descriptions of the individual columns in the CSV file.
  - The metadata makes use of 'common vocabularies' and 'unique identifiers' as recommended by the FAIR principles.
