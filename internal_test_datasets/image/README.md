# ABCE Open Data Project - Image data example


This folder contains an example of how to reuse metadata of internal test image dataset.
 
The dataset itself can be viewed here: https://figshare.com/s/7255e5f83ccc576059bc  (to be updated)

The files in this folder are:

- this README.md file.

- a Jupyter Notebook named 'examples_of_reusage_images.ipynb' which contains examples, written in Python, of how to show the image for a quick view. This notebook can be viewed directly in GitHub or on NBViewer here: https://nbviewer.org/github/building-energy/ABCE_Open_Data_Project/blob/main/internal_test_datasets/image/examples_of_reusage_images.ipynb
