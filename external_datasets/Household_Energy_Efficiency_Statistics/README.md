# ABCE Open Data Project - Household Energy Efficiency Statistics (HEE) data 

This folder contains an example of how to analyse the Household Energy Efficiency Statistics dataset published by the [Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-business-energy-and-industrial-strategy)

The cleaned dataset can be viewed here: 'Insert figsahre link'

The original datasaet itself can be downloaded here: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1084208/Headline_HEE_tables_23_June_2022.xlsx

The files in this folder are:

  * This ['README.md'](https://github.com/building-energy/ABCE_Open_Data_Project/blob/main/external_datasets/Household_Energy_Efficiency_Statistics/README.md) file. 
  * A Jupyter Notebook named ['data_converting_and_cleaning_process.ipynb'](https://github.com/building-energy/ABCE_Open_Data_Project/blob/main/external_datasets/Household_Energy_Efficiency_Statistics/data_converting_and_cleaning_process.ipynb) which describes the steps involved in cleaning the     original .xls dataset and formatting it to a .csv. 
  * A Jupyter Notebook named ['example_of_data_analysis_HEE.ipynb'](https://github.com/building-energy/ABCE_Open_Data_Project/blob/main/external_datasets/Household_Energy_Efficiency_Statistics/example_of_data_analysis_HEE.ipynb) which contains examples, written in Python, of how to analyse the dataset. 
  * A Jupyter Notebook named ['example_analysis_using_metadata_file.ipynb'](https://github.com/building-energy/ABCE_Open_Data_Project/blob/main/external_datasets/Household_Energy_Efficiency_Statistics/example_analysis_using_metadata_file.ipynb) which contain an example, written in Python, of how extract/ analyse the directly from the metadata.json file. 
  * A file named ['bar_chart_plot.png'](https://github.com/building-energy/ABCE_Open_Data_Project/blob/main/external_datasets/Household_Energy_Efficiency_Statistics/bar_chart_plot.png) which is an example plot created by the analysis in the Jupyter Notebook. As shown below.
