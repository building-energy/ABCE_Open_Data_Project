This is a sample FAIR interview data presented for researchers who would like to upload their own FAIR INTERVIEW DATA via ABCE Open Research Work. Please be aware that all documents are open resources obtained from British Geological Survey (BGS) in UK government website: https://data.gov.uk/dataset/0b747fe2-ce64-4234-8a90-cad3d47b4c0f/interview-data-to-assess-brave-project-impact-nerc-grant-ne-m008983-1, and only served as an example to guide the researchers about the correct format to create and upload their own data.This NERC granted research project is to assess BRAVE project impact through interview with target communities in Burkina and Ghana. This set of data is the second set of impact interviews conducted with the target communities of the BRAVE project. The interviews are transcriptions in TXT file. The communities involved in the data collection were from Tomo and Poa in Burkina Faso and Jawani and Tariganga in Ghana. There are 32 interviews from Burkinabe community members, and 23 from the Ghanaian communities. Individuals were selected based on their participation in the BRAVE field activity of the Farmer Voice Radio. The data was collected between October 2019 and February 2020 by the local researchers. This data methodology was built on the initial vulnerability assessments, and include questions around behaviour change and income change based on the BRAVE communities’ activities of ground water measurement and water management strategies. This data shows behaviour and livelihood change within the communities and due to these activities. This is final qualitative impacts dataset from the BRAVE project. Previous linked data sets include the baseline vulnerability assessments and the first round of impact interviews. BRAVE refers to Building understanding of climate variability into planning of groundwater supplies from low storage aquifers in Africa and is a ‘Consortium’ research project is part of the UPGro (Unlocking the Potential of Groundwater for the Poor) programme.Things to consider:- the video or audio interview data should be converted txt documents- more interview-related information may need to be considered to create the FAIR interview data. This kind of data is usually called Metadata. Metadata includes the related information about the raw interview data, for example, the sample of the intrviewees. - the interview templet (or the list of interview questions) itself should also be provided as a document ended with.csv or .json.- example analysis should also be included in a separate document ended with .csv or .json.
Data (including Metadata) to include:
- the interview questions - including the exact questions used, remarks/notes and their sub-questions/probs.- the raw interview data - the answers of each interview question answered by each interviewee- Abstract/background of the interview- Sample/type of participants/interviewees
- Information of each interviewee (if possible, refer to the ethical approval)- Language if known (English, Chinese, FrenchÉ) or translator- Time for completing the interview by each intervieweeTo help the researcher better understand the format and process of creating and uploading FAIR interview data, the following documents have been listed in this folder which provides an example:- A read-me.txt document which shows the basic information of this folder- A list of interview questions
- Sets of raw interview transcript
- A metadata document for the interview dataset- A metadata document for the interview template
