# ABCE Open Data Project

## What is the ABCE Open Data Project?

The ABCE Open Data Project is a project studying methods for publishing datasets as [FAIR data](https://www.go-fair.org/). 

It was funded as part of a Change Cultures Research Fund and took place in the School of Architecture, Building and Civil Engineering (ABCE) at Loughborough University in the spring and summer of 2022.

## What's in this GitHub repository?

This GitHub repostory contains the outcomes of the project. 

There are a selection of sample datasets which demonstrate how data can be published to meet some or all of the [FAIR data principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/).
