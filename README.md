## What is the ABCE Open Data Project?

The ABCE Open Data Project is a project studying methods for publishing datasets as [FAIR data](https://www.go-fair.org/). 

It was funded as part of a Change Cultures Research Fund and took place in the School of Architecture, Building and Civil Engineering (ABCE) at Loughborough University in the spring and summer of 2022.

This GitHub repostory contains the outcomes of the project. These are a selection of sample datasets which demonstrate how data can be published as FAIR data. 

Each dataset is contained in a different folder. Each folder contains:
