---UNDER DEVELOPMENT---

This is sample questionnaire data presented for the researchers who would like to upload their own FAIR QUESTIONNAIRE DATA via ABCE Open Research Work. Please be aware that this is the data downloaded from the Bank of England official open data website, which is only served as an example to guide the researchers about the correct format to update their own data.

The aim of the research of BoE is to investigate 'The financial position of British households' by a questionnaire survey from 2004 to 2011.

Things to consider:
- the raw questionnaire data of each year (from 2004 to 2011) should be converted from excel to .csv documents
- more information may need to be considered to create the FAIR questionnaire data. This kind of data is usually called/known as Metadata. Metadata includes the related information about the raw questionnaire date, for example, the sample of the questionnaire survey. 
- the questionnaire templet itself should also be provided as a document ended with .csv or .txt.
- example analysis may also be included in a separate document ended with .csv or .json.

Data to include:
- the questionnaire itself (i.e. the questionnaire templet) should be included - including the exact questions used and the response options etc.
- the raw data should include the answers of each question answered by each respondent

Metadata may be included:
- Abstract/background of the questionnaire survey
- Sample/type of participants/respondents
- Response rate & number of questionnaire distributed
- Language (English, Chinese, French�)
- Channel in which the questionnaire has been distributed and completed (i.e., on mobile, PC�.)
- Time for completing the questionnaire by each respondent
- Description and content of each question/item

To help the researcher better understand the format and process of creating and uploading FAIR questionnaire data, the following documents have been listed in this file which provides an example:
- A read-me.txt document which shows the basic information
- A questionnaire templet (.csv or .txt)
- A raw questionnaire data document or a set of documents for questionnaire data by different years
- A metadata document of the questionnaire templet
- A metadata document of the questionnaire data
